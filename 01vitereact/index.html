    <!-- This script is run by both: react and react-dom available in package.json
         They provide with all the methods
         
         Just like the browser makes a DOM, same way in memory a virtual dom is created 
         which can be accessed using ReactDom.
         
         React can only make SPA (single page application) b/z the html has just one element, i.e the root div
         and just one page index.html. In just this one page we keep removing and injecting elements that makes
         the user feel like he's navigating b/w different pages. -->
